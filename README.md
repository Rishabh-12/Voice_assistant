# Jravis
The project "Jravis" is inspired by the AI assistant of Iron Man, JARVIS, aiming to emulate its functionalities. It can send emails, search online, provide necessary information, and occasionally encounter errors. While I followed a tutorial to create it, this project serves as a source of inspiration for continuous self-improvement and upskilling.
